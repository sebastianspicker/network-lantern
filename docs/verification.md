# Verification

Run all commands from the repository root.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Pinned or minimum version | Used by |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PowerShell | 7+ | scripts, modules, and Pester |
| PSScriptAnalyzer | 1.24.0 | PowerShell static analysis |
| Pester | 5.7.1 | PowerShell tests |
| Bash | 4+ for the path entrypoint | Bash scripts and tests |
| ShellCheck | not pinned | Bash static analysis |
| Bats | not pinned | Bash tests |
| `jq` | not pinned | Bash JSON tests and live result processing |
| Git | not pinned | repository file enumeration and publication checks |
| `iperf3` | 3.7+ | live throughput only |
| `mtr` | not pinned | live Bash path diagnostics only |
| `column` | not pinned | Bash path summaries unless `--no-summary` is used |

Check the development dependencies:

```powershell
pwsh -NoProfile -NonInteractive -File .\scripts\Test-Prerequisites.ps1
```

Use `-IncludeIperf3` to check whether `iperf3` is on `PATH`. The prerequisite
script does not validate the Bash major version or the `iperf3` version. Those
checks occur in their live entrypoints.

## Complete local gate

From Bash, Git Bash, or WSL:

```bash
./scripts/ci-local.sh
```

This command runs, in order:

1. ShellCheck over the Bash entrypoints, scripts, and path libraries
2. all Bats tests under `tests/path`
3. `scripts/Invoke-SecretScan.ps1`
4. `scripts/ci.ps1 -NoInstall`

The final PowerShell phase runs the project identity check, PSScriptAnalyzer,
and all Pester tests. Pester writes NUnit XML to
`artifacts/testResults.xml`.

The complete gate does not install system packages. By default it also refuses
to install missing PowerShell modules. In an environment where user-scope
module installation is permitted, set:

```bash
NETWORK_LANTERN_INSTALL_MISSING_MODULES=1 ./scripts/ci-local.sh
```

This changes only the PowerShell module-installation behavior.

## PowerShell gate

Run without dependency installation:

```powershell
pwsh -NoProfile -NonInteractive -File .\scripts\ci.ps1 -NoInstall
```

Run without `-NoInstall` to install missing PSScriptAnalyzer 1.24.0 or Pester
5.7.1 for the current user before executing the gate:

```powershell
pwsh -NoProfile -NonInteractive -File .\scripts\ci.ps1
```

The script imports the exact pinned versions even if other versions are
installed. It fails when static analysis reports an issue, Pester discovers no
tests, or Pester reports a result other than `Passed`.

## Focused tests

Run a filtered Pester subset:

```powershell
pwsh -NoProfile -NonInteractive -File .\scripts\Invoke-Tests.ps1 `
  -Filter 'WindowsTuning'
```

The filter matches Pester full names. A filter that selects no tests fails.

Make targets:

| Target | Command |
| --- | --- |
| `make lint` | ShellCheck only |
| `make test-bash` | Bats only |
| `make test-pwsh` | `scripts/ci.ps1 -NoInstall` |
| `make test` | Bats, then the PowerShell gate |
| `make ci-local` | complete cross-shell gate |

## GitHub Actions

`.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs on pushes to `main`, pull requests targeting
`main`, and manual dispatch.

- `path-lint-test` runs the complete local gate on Ubuntu.
- `powershell-lint-test` runs the secret scan and PowerShell gate on Ubuntu and
  Windows.

The workflow pins third-party actions by commit and caches the two pinned
PowerShell modules.

## Preview checks

These commands validate execution planning without live probes or result-file
writes:

```powershell
pwsh -NoProfile -File .\apps\path\Test-NetworkPath.ps1 `
  -HostsIPv4 example.com -Protocols IPv4 -Rounds Standard -DryRun

pwsh -NoProfile -File .\apps\throughput\Measure-NetworkThroughput.ps1 `
  -Target iperf3.example.net -SingleTest -WhatIf

pwsh -NoProfile -File .\Invoke-NetworkLantern.ps1 `
  -Workflow Triage -IperfTarget iperf3.example.net -DryRun

pwsh -NoProfile -File .\apps\windows-tuning\Invoke-NetworkPathTuning.ps1 `
  -Action Apply -TuningProfile Safe -UdpPorts 5201 -DryRun -PassThru
```

The Bash equivalent is:

```bash
./apps/path/test-network-path.sh \
  --hosts4 example.com --types ICMP4,TCP4 --rounds Standard --dry-run
```

Preview modes still read configuration and validate inputs. A restore dry run
also reads and validates an existing backup. Invalid inputs return a nonzero
status.

Profile save and delete modes are exceptions to throughput preview behavior.
They change the selected profile store even when `-WhatIf` is also present.

## What the automated tests do not verify

The automated suites do not:

- contact the default public path targets
- run a live `iperf3` client against an external server
- visually test the Windows Forms throughput interface
- complete an elevated Windows tuning apply, injected failure, and restore
  cycle on a disposable VM

Tests cover plan construction, validation, output processing, process timeout
and cancellation behavior, exit codes, profile operations, orchestration,
Windows tuning dry runs, backup validation, and restore defenses.

## Troubleshooting

- If `scripts/ci.ps1 -NoInstall` reports a missing pinned module, run
  `scripts/ci.ps1` once where current-user installation is allowed.
- On Windows, make sure Bash dependencies and `pwsh` are visible from the same
  Git Bash or WSL environment that runs `scripts/ci-local.sh`.
- If a focused run selects no tests, use a substring from a Pester `Describe`,
  `Context`, or `It` name.
- Preserve LF line endings and Git mode `100755` for Bash entrypoints.
